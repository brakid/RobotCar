# Marker detection
* check all markers at once - ignore those that have been detected before ./
* locate car (require at least 2 markers)
* drive into direction based on coordinates
* estimate distance driven (time, wheel speed -> distance)
 * use accurate distance measures: get distance when staring -> calculate end distance based on distance to drive
